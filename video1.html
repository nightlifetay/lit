        <p>Connecting with you audience: A PowerPoint should serve as a visual megaphone, it should not be your voice but rather a tool that enhances its reach. The most important thing to consider when presenting a PowerPoint is that the PowerPoint is a visual reference for your audience, not you. At the same time, the audienceâ€™s attention should be anchored on you, not the PowerPoint. Use eye contact, body language and your physical location to ensure you remain in control of when the audience references your PowerPoint and when all eyes are on you.
	Use bullet points: Your PowerPoint is only a visual tool for your audience it should not be the focus of the presentation. You want to only layout key points and phrases that you need to make sure are written down and emphasized. Use bullet points to present shorter, simpler versions of the ideas you speak on to both illustrate their importance and lead into your full explanations. If you keep your use of bullet points between three and five per slide, and keep them simple, your audience will rely on you to fill in the gaps and elaborate. 
	Mix it up: The advantage of PowerPoint as opposed to old fashioned flip charts or poster boards is the option to embed images or multimedia files such as videos or Excel charts. When you a point needs more than a bullet point, or an interesting lead-in dedicating one slide to a relevant image is a great way to break the monotony of bullet points.</p>

<ul>To make the most effective PowerPoint, these are tips on how to keep your presentation clean, simple, yet creative:
	<li>Choose an effective layout design</li>
	<li>Double check the spelling and grammar of the content</li>
	<li>Keep the text simple by using bullet points and short sentences</li>
	<li>Make the labels on the charts and graphs understandable (Nothing To Complex)</li>
	<li>Use high contrast between background color and text color</li>
	<li>Use Monitor your audience's behavior</li>
	<li>Ask your audience to hold questions until the end (Feedback)</li>
