        <p>Hello World! I am Tanesha Taylor and I am a student of Year Up Chicago and Governors State University. I have over five years of Computer Software Systems experience. I’ve learned how to navigate operating systems on virtual machines, implement system policies, and troubleshoot software applications for users. Also, I specialize in hardware technical support and graphic design. I am very creative with graphics and designing promotion flyers, letters, and images.
        All my life I have been an energetic and entertaining person. I love to sing, dance, and laugh every day, even though I not a good singer. Hobbies of mines include video gaming, cooking, and traveling. Even when I am just relaxing with family and friends, I’m always have a good time while laughing and conversing with others.
        Technology has always been a part of my life, since the age of 6. I started in 1st grade, on the MAC desktops. At the time, I’m pretty sure that I didn’t know the difference between desktops and laptops. I never knew technology would make a big impact on my life. As I grown into a young adult, I’ve learned a lot of advanced skills on how to operate a machine, both on the software and hardware side. By May 2017, I will be earned my Bachelor’s in Science from Governors State University.
